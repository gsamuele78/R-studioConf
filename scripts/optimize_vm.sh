# Proxmox VM Performance Optimizer
#
# Description:
# This script applies performance optimizations to a specific KVM virtual machine
# in a Proxmox 8.x environment. It configures CPU, memory, disk, and network
# settings for high-performance workloads like R-Studio Server on Ceph storage.
#
# The script is designed to be idempotent (re-runnable).
#
# Usage:
# 1. Fill out the variables in 'conf/optimize_vm.conf'.
# 2. Run the script from the project root: ./optimize_vm.sh
#
# Requirements:
# - Run on the Proxmox host.
# - 'jq' utility for parsing VM configuration (apt-get install jq).
# - A corresponding configuration file.
